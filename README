To use loader.js, include the following <script> tag in an HTML document,
changing the attribute values as appropriate:

  <script src="http://somewhere.com/path/to/loader.js"
          require="/module/root/directory#absolute/module/id">
  </script>

Since loader.js is a static file, you can load it from anywhere.  The more
people who load it from the same place, the more likely it is to be cached
when a user visits your site.  That's always nice.

The "require" attribute provides two pieces of information, delimited by
the '#' character.  The first should be a URL pointing to the directory
that contains curator.py.  This directory does not have to be hosted at
the same domain as loader.js.  The second half of the attribute is the
absolute id of the first module to load.

If one were to replace the '#' in the "require" attribute with a '/', and
append ".min.js", the resulting URL would identify the JavaScript file
containing the initial module.
