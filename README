To use hermes.js, include the following <script> tag in an HTML document,
changing the attribute values as appropriate:

  <script src="http://somewhere.com/path/to/hermes.js"
          require="/module/root/directory#absolute/module/id">
  </script>

Since hermes.js is a static file, you can load it from anywhere.  The more
people who load it from the same place, the more likely it is to be cached
when a user visits your site.  That's always nice.

The "require" attribute provides two pieces of information, delimited by
the '#' character.  The first should be a URL pointing to the directory
that contains zeus.py.  This directory does not have to be hosted at the
same domain as hermes.js.  The second half of the attribute is the
absolute id of the first module to load.

If one were to replace the '#' in the "require" attribute with a '/', and
append ".min.js", the resulting URI would identify the JavaScript file
containing the initial module.
