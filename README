To use hermes.js, include the following <script> tag in an HTML document,
changing the attribute values as appropriate:

  <script src="http://somewhere.com/path/to/hermes.js"
          lib="http://anywhere.net/module/root/directory"
          require="absolute/id/of/initial/module"
          onload="use(this)">
  </script>

Since hermes.js is a static file, you can load it from anywhere.  The more
people who load it from the same place, the more likely it is to be cached
when a user visits your site.  That's always nice.

The "lib" attribute should name the directory that contains zeus.py and
.htaccess.  This directory does not have to be hosted at the same domain as
hermes.js.

The "onload" attribute is boilerplate.  After long consideration, I think
it's the most reliable way to tell hermes.js about the <script> tag that
loaded it, so that hermes.js can examine the "lib" and "require"
attributes.  In case you're curious, hermes.js sets window.use, saving the
old value, and window.use replaces the old value when called.  Since the
onload handler fires synchronously after script execution, the window.use
function is never externally observable.
